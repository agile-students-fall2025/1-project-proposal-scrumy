## What and Why

Project Crux is a mobile web app for indoor climbers to track progress and share beta (tips and sequences for completing routes).

Climbing gyms reset their walls often, and climbers lose track of sends or forget the strategies that worked. Project Crux provides a personal logbook and community platform to record climbs, share beta, and connect with others.

This matters because climbing is both personal and social. Many climbers want to measure progression (e.g. sending their first V4) while also learning from peers. Currently, solutions are scattered or informal; Project Crux unifies them into one accessible space.

## For Whom?

Project Crux is for indoor climbing/bouldering enthusiasts who climb regularly at gyms. Our inital end-users will be:

- Members at local climbing gyms
- Beginner to intermediate climbers who want to track progress and stay motivated.
- Advanced climbers who want to share and view beta from peers.

## How?

From an end-user perspective, Project Crux will allow climbers to:

- **Log climbs** â€“ track routes, grades, attempts, and notes.
- **Share beta** - upload text, images, or short videos.
- **Create profiles** â€“ showcase skill level, home gym, and interests.
- **Discover community beta** â€“ browse advice for climbs at their gym.
- **See whoâ€™s climbed what** â€“ connect through shared progress.
- **Track progress over time** â€“ visualize sends and grade progression.

Rather than just a tracker, the app fosters a sense of community around each climb.

## Scope

- **Core features** (logging climbs, Core features (logging, profiles, beta sharing) provide a strong foundation.
- **Community features** (climb-specific beta, shared logs) add complexity without being overwhelming.
- To stay manageable, we will focus on a limited set of gyms and avoid large-scale databases or social media-level features.

By semesterâ€™s end, Project Crux will be a practical, engaging tool for climbers at local gyms, with room to expand further.
